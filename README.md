# 673-final 期末考猜題
## Sample Questions
1. Explain why microservices should have low coupling and high cohesion. 

- In microservices architecture, low coupling and high cohesion are essential characteristics.
- Low coupling means that services should be loosely connected, while high cohesion means that services should be highly focused.
- Having low coupling and high cohesion allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance in microservices architecture.
2. You are a software product manager for a company developing educational software products based around scientific simulations to be used by colleges. Explain why it is important to develop a product roadmap so that final product releases are available in the first three months of the year. 

- Developing a product roadmap for first quarter releases is important for timeliness, competitive advantage, and revenue generation.
- A product roadmap can help ensure that product releases are planned and executed efficiently, taking into account development, testing, and deployment timelines.

3. In the context of RESTful services, explain what is meant by a ‘resource’. How do RESTful services address resources and operate on them? 

- In RESTful services, a resource is a unit of information that can be accessed and manipulated through a well-defined interface.
- RESTful services operate on resources using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- Examples of resources in an educational software product could include student records, course schedules, and quiz questions.
- HTTP methods allow clients to access and modify resources in a RESTful service.

### Product Manager
- Product management is a complex discipline that requires multiple skills to master.
- A framework for effective product management consists of six core knowledge areas and six supporting ones.
- The six core areas are vision and leadership, product life cycle management, product strategy and market research, business model and financials, product roadmap, and user experience and product backlog.
- The supporting areas are general market knowledge, development/technologies, marketing, sales and support, project/release management, and process.
- Effective product management requires establishing a shared vision, setting realistic goals, managing stakeholders, actively listening, negotiating, and making tough product decisions.
- It also involves understanding the product life cycle, identifying target users and customers, segmenting the market, performing competitor analysis, and positioning the product.
- The financial aspect of product management involves understanding business goals, describing how the product's value proposition is monetized, creating a financial forecast or business case, and working with colleagues from the finance department.
- Creating a product roadmap requires formulating realistic product goals, metrics and key performance indicators, release dates or timeframes, and key features. It also involves formulating a go-to-market strategy and understanding when the roadmap should be reviewed and changed.
Delivering a great user experience involves describing the desired user experience, creating scenarios, epics, user stories, storyboards, workflow diagrams, and storymaps, prioritizing and managing the product backlog, and selecting sprint goals.
- The supporting knowledge areas involve understanding current customers and users, software technologies, marketing channels, sales channels, project/release management, and ideation and innovation processes.
- The framework can be used to define specific product roles and identify gaps in product knowledge, as well as to determine learning measures for individuals or groups of product managers or product owners.
### Devops
- DevOps is a set of practices and cultural values that promote collaboration and integration between development and operations teams.
- It involves breaking down traditional silos and fostering a shared sense of responsibility for delivering and maintaining a product or service.
- DevOps aims to automate software delivery and infrastructure management using tools like continuous integration and delivery, automated testing, and infrastructure as code.
- Observability is a critical component of DevOps, enabling teams to monitor and measure the performance and behavior of software and infrastructure in real-time.
- A DevOps culture values collaboration, transparency, continuous learning and improvement, and a willingness to experiment and take risks.
- DevOps requires a holistic approach to software and infrastructure development, with a focus on aligning business objectives with IT goals.
- Overall, DevOps is about improving the efficiency, quality, and reliability of software delivery and infrastructure management through a collaborative and continuous approach.

### Agile
- Agile development is a widely adopted methodology in software development.
- However, many projects claiming to be Agile may not be truly Agile.
- Agile is a mindset for software development, not just a process or toolbox.
- People and interactions should be valued over processes and tools.
- Agile recognizes change as inevitable and provides meetings to manage it.
- Self-organizing teams are effective teams, and practices cannot be imposed on a team.
- Work should be done as late as possible, and success cannot be easily replicated in software development.
- Respect for people is important, and communication is key.
- The Agile mindset complements Agile processes and practices.
- Agile processes and practices should be seen as a toolbox to pick from as needed, not a rigid set of rules.
### Scrum
- Scrum is an Agile framework for managing and completing complex projects.
- It was originally developed for software development projects, but can be applied to any project where flexibility and adaptability are required.
- The framework consists of three main roles: the Product Owner, the Scrum Master, and the Development Team.
- The Product Owner is responsible for creating and maintaining the product backlog, a prioritized list of features or tasks that need to be completed.
- The Scrum Master is responsible for facilitating the Scrum process and ensuring that the team is following the framework.
- The Development Team is responsible for delivering a potentially releasable product increment at the end of each sprint.
- Sprints are fixed-length iterations of one to four weeks, during which the team works to complete a set of items from the product backlog.
- Each sprint begins with a sprint planning meeting, where the team plans what work they will complete during the sprint.
- Daily scrum meetings are held to provide updates on progress and identify any obstacles or issues that need to be addressed.
- At the end of each sprint, the team holds a sprint review to demonstrate the completed work to stakeholders and receive feedback.
- The sprint ends with a sprint retrospective, where the team reflects on the sprint and identifies areas for improvement.
- Scrum emphasizes self-organizing teams, with team members collaborating and taking ownership of their work.
- The framework is designed to be flexible and adaptable, with the team able to adjust their approach based on feedback and changing circumstances.
- Scrum can be combined with other Agile methodologies, such as Kanban or Extreme Programming (XP), to create a hybrid approach.
- To successfully implement Scrum, it is important to have buy-in from all team members and stakeholders, and to have a clear understanding of the framework and its principles.
